A toy sat solver I wrote mostly one evening after a class in verified software systems at the TUHH.
Its not fast but it does not require you to enter your formula in cnf or dnf.
Currently it eats memory because the hashmap I use for the ITE algorithm in bdd.ml puts pointers on many objects in the weak hashmap. I do not care...

Have fun,
